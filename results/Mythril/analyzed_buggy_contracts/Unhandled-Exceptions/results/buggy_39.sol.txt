The return value of a message call is not checked.
External calls return a boolean value. If the callee contract halts with an exception, 'false' is returned and execution continues in the caller. It is usually recommended to wrap external calls into a require statement to prevent unexpected states.

A call to a user-supplied address is executed.
The callee address of an external message call can be set by the caller. Note that the callee can contain arbitrary code and may re-enter any function in this contract. Review the business logic carefully to prevent averse effects on the contract state.
