A call to a user-supplied address is executed.
The callee address of an external message call can be set by the caller. Note that the callee can contain arbitrary code and may re-enter any function in this contract. Review the business logic carefully to prevent averse effects on the contract state.

Arbitrary senders other than the contract creator can withdraw ETH from the contract account without previously having sent an equivalent amount of ETH to it. This is likely to be a vulnerability.

The return value of a message call is not checked.
External calls return a boolean value. If the callee contract halts with an exception, 'false' is returned and execution continues in the caller. It is usually recommended to wrap external calls into a require statement to prevent unexpected states.
