Persistent state write after call
The contract account state is changed after an external call to a user defined address. Consider that the called contract could re-enter the function before this state change takes place

Anyone can withdraw ETH from the contract account.
Arbitrary senders other than the contract creator can withdraw ETH from the contract account without previously having sent an equivalent amount of ETH to it. This is likely to be a vulnerability.
