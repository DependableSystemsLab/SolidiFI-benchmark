Anyone can withdraw ETH from the contract account.
Arbitrary senders other than the contract creator can withdraw ETH from the contract account without previously having sent an equivalent amount of ETH to it. This is likely to be a vulnerability.

Use of tx.origin is deprecated.
The smart contract retrieves the transaction origin (tx.origin) using msg.origin. Use of msg.origin is deprecated and the instruction may be removed in the  future. Use msg.sender instead.
